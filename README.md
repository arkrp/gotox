added prototype gotox interpreter



hi this is nexec
this is a small project for a interpreter library for a non programing language logical code
I made this logical code specification myself and it is intended for hobbyists

gotox is a code intednde for hobbyist neural network experimentation
the code itself serves as a logical framework for converting inputs to outputs folloing ceartain rules

this is made by a high school kid so dont take it too seriously
 i'm new to github
